The financial technology company **Cinnober** held a makeathon challange together with Sliperiet in Ume√•, 2016. They wanted to explore new ways of displaying data without a screen, and we came up with the idea of **graf**. An in-office sculpture that shows complex server behaviour and flows for the technicians. 

This is the Arduino code for the prototype we showed at the challenge. Keep in mind that this was a limited time makeathon so it's not the most beutiful code, but we could at least show the functionality!
